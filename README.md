# Aim of project
Neural network that produces 10 english village names

## Village Name

Run `python3 village_name_maker.py` for some fun english village name-based fun.

## Village finder
An extrememly messy script that once upon a time produced `englissh_village_names.txt` but since the number of english villages is probably staying the same, I'd leave this be.

## More functionality
See the docs for [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/blob/master/docs/textgenrnn-demo.ipynb) for more advice about how to get this to work properly.
