# Aim of project
Neural network that produces fictional english village names. Trained on a list of all the 16,599 english village names on Wikipedia.
Eventually I guess I'll save all this in a nicely formatted ipython notebook. 

## Village Name Maker
Run `python3 village_name_maker.py` for some fun english village name-based fun. 

## Village finder
An extrememly messy script that once upon a time produced `english_village_names.txt` by scraping wikipedia. Might be adaptable for future use as a general purpose wikipedia scraper.  

## More functionality
See the docs for [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/blob/master/docs/textgenrnn-demo.ipynb) for more advice about how to get this to work properly.
